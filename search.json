    "text": "Introduction\nSo far, we have been describing heat transfer in terms of what happens to a given parcel of fluid. A transient model must instead describe what happens at a given point in the flow field.\nThe temperature of fluid at different points along a pipe is a result of multiple factors:\n\nHeat exchange between the fluid and its surroundings. (The effect of the ambient conditions)\nMovement through the pipe: If the fluid temperature is not uniform, we should observe areas of high and low temperature moving with the fluid.\nHeat diffusion within the fluid: The temperature of the fluid should become more uniform over time, all else equal.\nMaybe some effect from pressure change. It’s unclear how relevant this is and I don’t expect it to have a huge effect in pipes.\n\nOur current model accounts for #1 and #4, but not #2 and #3. There is an implicit assumption that the parcels of fluid either side of the one we follow through a pipe had the same conditions leaving the emitter, and that these parcels of fluid have no effect on their neighbours."

    "text": "The fluid loses heat to the surroundings when it is above ambient temperature and absorbs heat when below.\nThis is probably the easiest part to model. At each point, \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta t}_{a} will be proportional somehow to the difference in temperature between the fluid and ambient. The temperature difference and the u value of the pipe wall determine the rate of energy transfer, and the specific heat at constant pressure will determine how that translates into temperature change.\n\n\nShow the code\nusing Plots\n\nplot(x -&gt; 1 / ℯ^x,\n    0,\n    2π,\n    label=\"temperature\",\n    xlabel=\"time\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Temperature falling over time"
