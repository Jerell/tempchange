# Ambient

The fluid loses heat to the surroundings when it is above ambient temperature and absorbs heat when below.

This is probably the easiest part to model. At each point, $\frac{\delta T}{\delta t}_{a}$ will be proportional somehow to the difference in temperature between the fluid and ambient. The temperature difference and the $u$ value of the pipe wall determine the rate of energy transfer, and the specific heat at constant pressure will determine how that translates into temperature change.

This part requires looking up fluid properties.
